### Slami
Scrapes images dynamically while you type. Then assembles your text and images and generates a 
slideshow-video in `.webm` format using a canvas hack with 
[`whammy.js`](https://github.com/antimatter15/whammy).

### Final version
The project has been fully realized and is available here: https://github.com/Nikaoto/Slami
